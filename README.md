 Learning web components

- Create a blink component. Everyone is lamenting the fact the blink tag has been removed.
- Your blink component should take an attribute that defines the text it displays.
- Use setInterval() to make the text "blink". You'll need to add an interval when the - Component is created and remove when the component is removed from the DOM. Use the lifecycle methods for this.
- Use connectedCallback()
- Use disconnectedCallback() to clear your interval
- Use an attribute to set the time between blinks
- Use two properties, one to set the on-time and another for the off-time.
